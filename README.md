This project was just following a tutorial to explore the real-time update capabilities of firebase. Originally, I had shied away from Firebase as a database, and wanted to build my own backend to have full control. Additionally, I bought into the GraphQL API hype and fully embraced it, which Firebase did not have. 
After this project, I fell in love with the convenience of Firebase’s backend as a service model and have been using it since. I wouldn’t use it for a large-scale project but for my current skill-level, it is perfect for me to keep pumping out projects.

This chat is currently functional. If you have two different google accounts, you can use one in private/incognito mode, log into two different accounts and send chats across. You would however have to fully type in the Gmail properly. This project is currently deployed at the following web address:
